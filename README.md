## Known Bugs:

<ul>
    <li>When gaining Treasure Fleets with the Inflation Crisis, if the Settlement already produced Treasure Fleets, the number shown will be wrong. This is just a visual bug, as upon unloading the Treasure Fleets the correct amount of Treasure will be given.</li>
    <li>For the Succession Crisis, grievances caused by the Crisis will say "From a Diplomatic Action".</li>
</ul>

## Latest Update:
