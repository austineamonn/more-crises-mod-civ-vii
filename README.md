# More Crises Civ VII Mod

Author: austineamonn

Version 1.1.3

Adds 4 new crises to the Antiquity and Exploration age. Optional changed Traditions for the Base Crises. More Crises to come!

## Current Mod:

Adds the Famine and Succession Crises to Antiquity and the Inflation and Isolationism Crises to Exploration. Depending on your build these crises can be much more punishing than the Base Game ones, so beware. You can select which crises you want (or don't want) by clicking the Advanced Options button before launching your game. All crises (including Base Game crises) start enabled but you can toggle whichever ones you don't want to disable them. The More Crises Settings allows you to toggle whether the Base Game Crises use their original traditions or the alternate harsher ones.

### Isolationism Crisis - Exploration

Crisis policies impact your Trade Routes. As the crisis intensifies Trade Limits will decrease (one per crisis level). The crisis unlocks a new Town Specialization, Internal Trade Town. This specialization reduces your Trade Range by 5 and grants 5 Gold per connected Settlement. Note that if you have more Trade Route with a leader than your Trade Limit Allows, Trade Routes will be lost until you are under the limit. In other words, if you do not increase your Trade Limit with leaders, this crisis will delete all your trade routes and you will have to resend merchants.

First Crisis Level:

-1 Trade Route Limit (cannot reduce the limit below 0). Unlocks a new Town Specialization, Internal Trade Town. Unlock one crisis policy slot.

Policies:

<ol>
    <li>Trade Protectionism: -3 Gold and Influence for each imported Resource.</li>
    <li>Shipping Ban: -20 Gold per Trade Route.</li>
    <li>Hermit Kingdom: -20 Gold on Towns without the Internal Trade Town Specialization.</li>
</ol>

Second Crisis Level:

-1 Trade Route Limit (cannot reduce the limit below 0). Unlock one crisis policy slot.

Policies:

<ol>
    <li>Cultural Seclusion: -5 Science and Culture for each Social Policy, but not Tradition, slotted.</li>
    <li>Resettlement: -1 Specialist Cap. +50% Growth Rate in Towns.</li>
</ol>

Third Crisis Level:

-1 Trade Route Limit (cannot reduce the limit below 0). Unlock two crisis policy slots.

Policies:

<ol>
    <li>Book Ban: -2 Science and Culture on displayed Great Works.</li>
    <li>Religious Intolerance: -10 Happiness on Temples.</li>
</ol>

Age Transition Unlocks:

Just like the in game Crises, you can unlock extra cards at Age Transition if you meet certain conditions.

## Known Bugs:

<ul>
    <li>For the Succession Crisis, grievances caused by the Crisis will say "From a Diplomatic Action".</li>
    <li>For the Alternate Invasion Crisis, if a player is eliminated with Inferior Tactics slotted, the extra strength for independent powers will remain.".</li>
</ul>

## Latest Update:

Added Alternative, more difficult, Traditions to the Antiquity Revolts Crisis. Changed a tradition on the alt invasion crisis. Made alt crises the default.

## Notes:

Since the AI always seem to slot Inferior Tactics, the Alternate Invasion Crisis is very painful on large and huge map sizes where independent powers could gain at least +20 strength.
