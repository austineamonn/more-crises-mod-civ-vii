Author: austineamonn

Version 1.0.2

Adds new crises to the Antiquity and Exploration age. More Crises to come!

## Current Mod:

Adds a Famine Crisis to Antiquity and an Inflation Crisis to Exploration.

    <li>Empty Storage: -5 Gold on Warehouse Buildings in Towns.</li>

</ol>

Policies - "Let them build shanty towns in the Cities"

<ol>
    <li>City Slum: -5 Gold on Food Buildings in Cities.</li>
    <li>City Migration: -50% Growth Rate in Cities.</li>
</ol>

Policies - Second Crisis Level

<ol>
    <li>Food Insecurity: -5 Food on Urban Districts.</li>
    <li>Knowledge Loss: -2 Science from Specialists.</li>
    <li>Death of the Artists: -2 Culture from Specialists.</li>
</ol>

</ol>

## Known Bugs:

<ul>
    <li>When gaining Treasure Fleets with the Inflation Crisis, if the Settlement already produced Treasure Fleets, the number shown will be wrong. This is just a visual bug, as upon unloading the Treasure Fleets the correct amount of Treasure will be given.</li>
</ul>

## Latest Update:

Added Traditions for Succession Crisis.
